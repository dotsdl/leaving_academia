## Leaving academia: building your runway to a career outside of the ivory tower

The U.S. produces ~50,000 new Ph.D. holders each year, and there is simply not enough room in the academic job market to absorb them all.  Of these, a portion will go on to pursue post-doctoral work.  After four to eight years in the post-doc circuit, a small portion of these will finally land permanent, tenure-track positions.  All told, <10% of Ph.D. students will eventually become tenure-track faculty.

To pursue an academic career is a unique challenge, but it's important to assess whether it's the challenge you actually want.  There is often little guidance within academic departments on how to pursue other career paths, despite the fact that most Ph.D. students will pursue those paths.  This talk is aimed at addressing questions you may have as a Ph.D. student on making your exit from academia, and how to build your runway to a fulfilling and exciting career outside of the ivory tower.
